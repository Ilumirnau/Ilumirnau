### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


About myself:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on measurement-induced phase transitions.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concepts related to bash to automate random quantum circuits' simulations.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects regarding the study of different critical properties of MIPTs.
- :thought_balloon: I'm very interested in topics like multipartite entanglement :link:, quantum chaos :sparkler: and quantum thermodynamics :fire:.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about any of the projects in my repositories, I'll be happy to discuss the results or procedures here!
