### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


About myself:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on quantum computation projects using the [qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) library among other tools to improve my coding skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concepts related to the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH) to test the integrability of spin systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects regarding quantum algorithms and other quantum related simulations.
- :thought_balloon: I'm very interested in topics like multipartite entanglement :link:, quantum chaos :sparkler: and quantum thermodynamics :fire:.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of the projects in my repositories, I'll be happy to discuss about the results or procedures in here!
